								<Card.Text>
									Archaeology provides us with the opportunity to learn about
									past cultures through the study of what was left behind and
									environmental changes. Studying these artifacts and the
									context we find them in helps to provide us with some insight
									about what life was like for past peoples.

								<Card.Title>Technology</Card.Title>
								<Card.Text>
									A well-documented diagnostic trait of an Oneota prehistoric
									site is the ceramic technology. Oneota groups manufactured
									shell-tempered globular jars with a constricted hole and a
									rounded bottom. Particularly unique to southeastern WI is the
									use of digging sticks for agriculture. Lithics (stone tools)
									include small, unnotched triangular arrow points, end scrapers
									and sandstone abraders.
